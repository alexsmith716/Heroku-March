# Heroku-March


### ABOUT:

App deployed here:

* https://sleepy-wave-92667.herokuapp.com/

Took hours and hours to figure out but it works (minus Google Book and Rick And Morty query fetches).

Had to add option `outputPath` to `ChunkExtractor` for Heroku to recognize webpack node build.

As I read somewhere, "Heroku is easy to use, until it isn't."
